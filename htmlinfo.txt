(client) browser connects to where the website is hosted (server) - hhtp request
website is displayed - http response

after receiving the response, the browsers constructs the DOM: DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
DOM is basically a respresentation of the objects in our html document (basically all the building blocks of your page, like paragraphs, images, etc)
so after constructing the DOM, it knows what it needs to load (render) the page
the browser then sends http requests (in parallel to make things faster) to retrieve information accordingly (html, css, js) and then finally,
renders it.

provide good description for images (SEO TIP)
add alt text too, because if image can't be loaded, alt text is shown

you can add a "comment" or so to speak, in html, by using the <!> tag anything inside <! efiubfikbr> like this, will be ignored by the browser.

html files start or have the main page at index.html
images that are put in src inside the img tag have their location specified with respect to the html file. for example in T1's index.html,
it was in images/food.png

doctype declarations are usually all caps, but everything else is small, conventionally.

if you set the border radius of an image to exactly half its size, so if the img is 100px, and the border rad is 50px,
you get a perfect circle.

each attribute can be assigned to a different class for styling rules.
for example, if a paragraph element is assigned a class called username, like this: <p class="username">
then in the style part, we can create a section for p.username, or just .username, so that all elements assigned to username class are affected.
