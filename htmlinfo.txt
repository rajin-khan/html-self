(client) browser connects to where the website is hosted (server) - hhtp request
website is displayed - http response

after receiving the response, the browsers constructs the DOM: DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL
DOM is basically a respresentation of the objects in our html document (basically all the building blocks of your page, like paragraphs, images, etc)
so after constructing the DOM, it knows what it needs to load (render) the page
the browser then sends http requests (in parallel to make things faster) to retrieve information accordingly (html, css, js) and then finally,
renders it.

add alt text too, because if image can't be loaded, alt text is shown
