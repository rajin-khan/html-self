T1 (PROVIDING CSS)

There are three different ways to providing css in webpages.

embedded stylesheets (when you put the style section directly in the html)
problems: not scalable, violates separation of concerns.

external stylesheets (separate css files)
more preferred.

inline styles (applied directly to a particular html element)

you can call the external style sheets anything, the name doesn't matter. However, styles.css is pretty common.
so, we don't have to create a separate style element in the html doc, just create a .css stylesheet, and then in the html doc head section,
use the <link/> (self closing tag) and add the .css file in href. the rel attribute is just what you describe the file to be that is related.

now, should we never use embedded styles?
no, that's not the case. sometimes you may want to override your external stylesheet rules.
so, even after linking, you can create a new <style> element and override the external stylesheet rules.

now, we've seen how embedded style overrides external stylesheets, but even overriding that is the inline styles.

every single html element has it's own style attribute.
so, for example, you could take the <p> element, and add <p style= ""> to add embedded styles.
AVOID THIS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. better to use unique identifiers.

so for <p>, add: <p id="first">, then use #first in the style part to just edit the first paragraph.
